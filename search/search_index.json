Analysis This portion of the guide will explain how to normalize conditions, compare individual metabolites, enter time points, and enter quantitative standards. 6.1 Compare Metabolites This button allows the user to generate graphs directly comparing metbolite abundance, enrichment, or individual isotopologue labeling across metabolites and conditions. 6.1.0 Make the Options Appear Make the options appear by hovering over the Compare Metabolites Button and then left click. 6.1.1 Select which Conditions First the user needs to click and drag each condition they want included in the graph below the area that says To Graph. Wait for the blue rectangle to appear then let go: Items can move back and forth between Condition List and To Graph, if the user changes their mind. 6.1.2 Data List Next, the user needs to select the metabolite, fragment, and data type they want to include in the graph. All three are handled by a drop down menu. Make the selections for each type: As shown a button labeled Add Data will appear once all three options are selected. Click Add Data to add the data entry to the data list: Add more metabolite-fragment-data type combinations by performing the drop down menu selections again. 6.1.3 Submit or Abort Changes Submit your selections by clicking Submit Metabolite Selections to generate a graph of the specified data across the specified condition, or abort selections by clicking the X in the top right. Submit: Abort: 6.2 Normalize Abundances This button allows the user to normalize metabolite abundances to a specific experimental condition, an internal standard (metabolite) and/or by cell numbers/sample mass. 6.2.1 Make Options Appear Hover over Enter Cell Number and left click to make the menu appear. 6.2.2 Condition to Normalize to Click the drop down menu and select the group that you would like all metabolite abundances to normalized to. The default selection is N/A, meaning abundances will not be normalized to a specific condition. A common selection for this option would be the wild-type or control condition of your study. After Selection: AVI 6.2.3 Metabolite to Normalize to Select an individual metabolite to normalize everything to by clicking the drop down menu and selecting the metabolite. The default selection is N/A, meaning abundances will not be normalized to a specific metabolite/fragment. A common selection for this option would be the internal standard included in all samples. After Click: Scroll through until you find the desired metabolite and left click after hovering over the metabolite name. 6.2.4 Enter Cell Number/Sample Mass for Each Group Enter the measured cell number or sample for each group by clicking the white box and typing the appropriate number. The default selection is 1, meaning abundances will not be normalized to a specific cell number or sample mass. 6.2.5 Submit or Abort Changes Submit your selections by clicking Submit Form or Abort Changes by clicking the X in the top right.

The majority instructions for how to interact with the table can be found above in the Metabolites to Display section of the guide. The main difference is how to select the individual metabolite\u2019s isotopologue limit. Rather than checking a box, the user must click a dropdown menu and select an isotopolgue which will be used as the upper range for the displayed isotopologues. For example, selecting M3 results in M0, M1, M2, M3 isotopologue data being included for graph of the selected metabolite/fragment. The default selection for all metabolites/fragments is all isotopologues included in the uploaded data file. The isotopologue will be applied to ALL graph types of the selected metabolite. NOTE: The selected isotopologue limit is important for Mole Percent Enrichment calculations and graphs, as only isotopologues through the selected isotopologue are included in the enrichment calculation, and the selected isotopologue limit is assumed to be the total number of carbons in the selected metabolite/fragment. For example if M4 is selected for a fragment, Escher Trace assumes that there are 4 carbons in the metabolite and calculates the enrichment with this number.

Getting Started 1.1 Introduction The goal of this visualization tool is to make 13C isotope tracing data more accessible by improving data presentation and streamlining analysis. 1.1.1 What is isotope tracing? Stable isotope tracing is a technique used to track the passage of an isotope through metabolic pathways in order to understand metabolic fluxes. By applying a stable isotope labeled metabolite to a cell or in vivo system, insight into how that metabolite is catabolized can be made by analyzing where the heavy isotopes go. 1.1.2 What is Escher Trace? Escher Trace simplifies the process of analyzing isotope tracing data by generating publication quality graphs of stable isotope tracing data on top of a metabolic map. Current features include: Upload data in a simple JSON or CSV format requiring only minor modifications to be made from mass spectrometer data sets Correct isotopic labeling for natural 13C abundance Automatically generate publication quality graphs of: Mass isotopomer distribution Metabolite abundance Mole percent enrichment Kinetic labeling and abundance Export graphs in svg format, allowing for seamless integration with vector graphics editors (such as Adobe Illustrator). Full control over data normalization and sample/condition grouping Save and reload your workspace so you can start and stop analysis or easily transfer data to collaborators. Integration with Escher Maps, allowing for simple loading and editing of pathway maps. 1.2 Metabolic Maps The tool currently has maps for the TCA Cycle, Serine metabolism, and Branched Chain Amino Acid catabolism available. Other maps are available through the use of Escher, in order to understand how to get these maps use Escher Guide to import the desired map. Let us know which maps are needed here (make a link to a form of some sort) and we will work on adding it for you! 1.2.1 Metabolic Map Editing All of the changes to be made to the maps follow the same instructions as the Escher maps as they are the same, this set of dropdown menus at the top is where to start: 1.3 Formatting Tracer Data Tracing data can be imported into Escher Trace in a CSV format (insert schema) 1.4 Importing Tracer Data Now that the file is properly formatted, it is time to import the data to the Escher Trace. 1.4.1 Loading the file First click on the blue Import Tracing Data button in the bottom right of the screen. 1.4.2 Select File Type Click \"Choose File\" of the chosen file type: JSON or CSV 1.4.3 Select the File Browse through your files and select your tracing data file and click open. 1.4.4 Submitting Data If the user is uploading data for the first time the \"Organize Groups\" popup will appear, if they are uploading a JSON of a previously saved workspace then the previous workspace (graphs) will be upload. 1.4.5 Organize Groups Escher Trace generates graphs by averaging data from files which are grouped together. For example, you ran an experiment with two experimental conditions, (-)Drug and (+)Drug, these would be the groups you would need to create and organize your data files into. To begin creating groups, click the white text input box next to \"Group Name:\" and type the desired group name. Then click \u201cAdd Group\u201d After Add Group: 1.4.5.1 Assign to Groups To assign a specific data file to a group, click and drag to the data file right below the desired group name, wait for the blue rectangle to appear and let go of the click. Repeat these steps as needed. When finished click \"Submit Form\". If the file uploaded properly, bar graphs will appear around the metabolic map and a menu will appear in the top right of the screen. NOTE: If BIGG ID's were used for metabolite names in the submitted CSV or JSON data file, the data for those metabolites will appear next to the corresponding node on the Escher Map. If BIGG ID's were not used or if the node corresponding to a BIGG ID is absent from the Escher map, data will appear on the left hand side of the Escher Map. Before Upload: After Upload: 1.5 Navigate the Metabolic Map Move around the map using the same methods described in the escher map documentation https://escher.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started.html another way to access the documentation is by clicking the question mark at the top menu. 1.6 Using the Escher Trace Menu After importing a properly formatted data file, a drop down menu will appear in the top right of the map. Access menu options by hovering over the desired button and left click to make additional options appear. Shown below is Graph Type.
